1.  Download and Read CSV file
2.  Do some preprocessing techniques, like cleaning, replacing some null values, removing outliers, and etc.
3.  Based on the variant which you write on the theoretical part choose the dataset and do Linear or Logistic regression Machine Learning Model. (It should contain all the steps with visualization)
4.  Add in your .ipynb file some explanation, on actions which you did.
5.  Submit your code with explanation (.ipynb or / .html)

_*Note: Your variant on practice part the same as variant on theory_

_Design and explanations of jupyter notebook are very important, so write more explanations and your reasoning behind each code blocks_
