You can use only numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn libraries. Make sure that your code will be meaningful.
**Defense**: You have to do the presentation, where you will show how your code is working. You have to demonstrate your code. At the same time, you have to explain the methods which you have done.
**Result**: .ipynb/.html files with Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers and
presentation.
**Marks**: The assignment cost 5 points. For the code it will be given 3.5 points and for presentation 1.5 points.
