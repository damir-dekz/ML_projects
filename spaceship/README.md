> Assignment 3

The assignment should be done individually.  
**Task**: You have to use clean and preprocessed data from the Assignment 1, which contains **at least 2K samples with ground truth labels**. Also, trained models on 2 Regression types (Linear and Logistic) on your dataset. You need to check models for Overfitting/Underfitting. Try to apply on Overfitted/Underfitted model one or both types of regularizations. Check with learning curves when you need to stop your model to prevent Overfitting and Underfitting. Do hyperparameter optimization on the model. You can use only numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn libraries. Make sure that your code will be meaningful.  
**Defense**: You have to do the presentation, where you will show how your code is working. You have to demonstrate your code. At the same time, you have to explain the methods which you have done.  
**Result**: .ipynb/.html files with both types of regressions and presentation.  
**Marks**: The assignment cost 5 points. For the code it will be given 3.5 points and for presentation 1.5 points.  
**NOTE**: Make sure that you choose your dataset correctly, because you will use the same dataset in Assignment 4.
The assignment should be done individually.
